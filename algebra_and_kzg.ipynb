    "# 1. Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "One can define Mathematics as the field that studies patterns, as it contains a vast amount of subfields, each of which ultimately leads to the description and formalization of patterns and behaviors under the formalism of axioms and theorems. In fact, the whole Mathematic universe sustains itself on a series of axioms (statements that are taken as true), being the most widely used the [Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory) (ZF axioms), which are the basis of modern Set Theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is through set theory that we can define the most basic mathematical object: numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Number Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start with the set of Natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$, which most authors define as the set of all positive integers: $\\{1,2,3,4,\\dots\\}$ (we denote a set as a pair of $\\{\\}$ containing some/all of the elements of the set). If you're curious about how this set is constructed, check out [Wikipedia's article on the Set theoretic definition of natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers). Some mathematicians (like myself) would also include the number $0$ in this set, but for the sake of coherency with Least Authority's MoonMath manual, we'll stick to the former definition. In case one would want to explicitly include $0$ in the set of Natural numbers, some authors adopt the notation $\\mathbb{N}_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of Integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an extension of $\\mathbb{N}$ and is defined as the set of all positive and negative integers: $\\{\\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\\dots\\}$. The need of this extension is due to the fact that some operations (like subtraction $^*$) are not closed under $\\mathbb{N}$, meaning that the result of the operation is not necessarily an element of $\\mathbb{N}$. More on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of Rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is an extension of $\\mathbb{Z}$ and is defined as the set of all numbers that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers (assuming the divisor is non-zero): $\\{\\frac{a}{b} \\mid a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z}, b\\neq 0\\}$ (this reads like _\"the set composed by the quotients of $a$ and $b$, so that $a$ and $b$ are elements of the set of integers and $b$ is non-zero\"_). This extension also arises from the need of closure under some operations (like division $^*$).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to define the set of Irrational numbers (some authors denote it as $\\mathbb{I}$) and the set of Real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ together. $\\mathbb{I}$ is defined as the set of numbers that _\"cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers\"_, and $\\mathbb{R}$ can be easily defined as the union of $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{I}$: $\\mathbb{R} = \\mathbb{Q}\\cup\\mathbb{I}$. Given that we won't need these number sets for this session, we won't touch on the construction of $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{I}$. If curious, you may check out [Wikipedia's article on the construction of the real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_real_numbers) and [Wikipedia's article on irrational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, another set that is of general interest in mathematics is the set of Complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$, which is defined as the set of numbers that can be expressed as $a+bi$, where $a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $i$ is the imaginary unit, defined as $i^2=-1$. This set extends the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ and arises from the need of closure under some operations (like the square root of a negative number $^*$)\n",

    "$^*$ _Soon you wil see that \"subtraction\", \"division\" and \"square root\" are actually aliases for something else..._ ðŸ˜¯\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, we'll be working with the set of Integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ and the set of Natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$, so don't worry too much about the other sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Prime Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime number is a natural Number ($\\mathbb{N}$) that has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- is greater than 1\n",
    "- is divisible only by itself and $1$\n",
    "\n",
    "_Remember: $a$ is divisible by $b$ if_ $\\frac{a}{b}\\in\\mathbb{Z}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the set of prime numbers as $\\mathbb{P}$. Note that there is only one even prime number: $2$. Several authors denote $\\mathbb{P}_{\\geq 3}$ as the set of **odd** prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Coprime Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "It is said that two integers $a$ and $b$ are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is $1$. We denote this as $gcd(a,b)=1$. This means that $a$ and $b$ do not share any common factors other than $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example $gcd(4,9)=1$ ($4$ and $9$) are coprime, but $gcd(4,8)=4$ ($4$ and $8$ are not coprime). Usually, this is checked by means of the [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm). A more brute-force way to check if two numbers are coprime is to check if their prime factorization has any common factors. Let's take the previous examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $4$ and $9$ are coprime: $4=2^2$ and $9=3^2$, so they don't share any common factors\n",
    "- $4$ and $8$ are not coprime: $4=2^2$ and $8=2^3$ because they share the common factor $2$ twice! $4=2^2$ and $8=2^3=2\\cdot 2^2$, thus the GCD is $2^2=4$\n",
    "\n",
    "A fun corollary of this is that if either $a$ or $b$ is prime, then $gcd(a,b)=1$, i.e. the pair is co-prime. This is because a prime number can only be divided by itself and $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Modular aritmethic\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers \"wrap around\" upon reaching a certain valueâ€”the modulus _(doesn't this sound familiar with computer science's concept of integer overflow/underflow? A Solidity `uint256` type is a positive integer defined on modular arithmetic of modulus $2^{256}$ !_ ðŸ¤¯ _)_\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's take modulus 5, and add the numbers 4 and 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$4+3=7\\equiv 2\\quad\\text{mod}~5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Note that the symbol $\\equiv$ means \"equivalent\")_\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, $4$ plus $3$ is $7$, but if we \"wrap around\" the result to the modulus $5$, we get $2$. Another way to think about it is that every time we get a number that is greater than the modulus, we subtract the modulus until we get a number that is less than the modulus. i.e. we divide by the modulus and keep the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact same thing happens with multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2\\cdot 4=8\\equiv 3\\quad\\text{mod}~5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One can quickly notice that the modulus gives the number of possible results of the operation. In the previous example, we had $5$ possible results: $0,1,2,3,4$. So, if we are in modulus $n$ the set of numbers $\\{0,\\dots,n-1\\}$ are actually all the numbers we will ever get when doing arithmetic operations with modulus $n$. This set is denoted as $\\mathbb{Z_n}$ (other mathematicians, as myself, prefer denoting it as $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, but for the sake of coherency with Least Authority's MoonMath manual, we'll stick to the former notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts give rise to **equivalence classes**. To put it easy, an equivalente class is a set of numbers that _\"are equal\"_ under modulus $n$. From each equivalente class, we take _\"one representative number\"_ to identify each class. Let's go back again to our modulus $5$ example. As mentioned, $\\mathbb{Z}_5=\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$. So, the equivalence class of $0$ is $\\{\\dots,-5,0,5,10,15,\\dots\\}$, basically $\\{a\\mid a\\in\\mathbb{Z}, \\frac{a}{5}\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$. What about the equivalence class of $3$? Well, it's $\\{\\dots,-2,3,8,13,18,\\dots\\}$, basically $\\{a\\mid a\\in\\mathbb{Z}, \\frac{a - 3}{5}\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$. It's the set of numbers that _\"fall\"_ on the same number once wrapping around 5 (i.e. the set of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Note that the symbol $\\in$ means \"is an element of\")_\n",
    "\n",
    "If the equivalence classes remain unclear, think about a clock: it has $12$ hours, and once it reaches $12$, it goes back to $1$. So, the equivalence class of $1$ is $\\{\\dots,1,13,25,\\dots\\}$, the equivalence class of $2$ is $\\{\\dots,2,14,26,\\dots\\}$, and so on. The equivalence class of $12$<> is $\\{\\dots,0, 12,24,36,\\dots\\}$. That's why when a digital clock reads `13:00`, we say it's `1:00 PM`, because $13$ is equivalent to $1$ under modulus $12$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sets will give rise to interesting algebraic structures, as we'll see later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Basic Algebraic Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've seen some basic number sets and some basic arithmetic operations. Now, we'll see some basic algebraic structures that arise from these sets and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, what is Algebra? Many people think of Algebra as the study of equations, but that's not entirely true. Algebra is the study of mathematical structures, their properties and how to manipulate them. To put it simple, it is like having a _\"bag of objects\"_ and some _\"rules\"_ to manipulate those _\"objects\"_.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Doesn't this ring a bell for you? It's like having a `class` in Object Oriented Programming, and some `methods` to manipulate the `class` `instance` !_ ðŸ¤¯ _)_\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5.1 Abelian Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Any algebraic structure is defined through a set and an operation. Let's start with the most basic algebraic structure: the Abelian Group. An Abelian Group (also known as commutative group) $\\mathbb{G}$ is a tuple $(G,\\oplus)$ where $G$ is a set and $\\oplus$ is a binary operation (i.e. an operation that takes two elements of the set and returns another element) that satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Closure: $\\forall a,b\\in G, a\\oplus b\\in G$ (the elements returned by the operation are elements of the set).\n",
    "- Associativity: $\\forall a,b,c\\in G, (a\\oplus b)\\oplus c=a\\oplus(b\\oplus c)$\n",
    "- Identity element: $\\exists e\\in G, \\forall a\\in G, a\\oplus e=e\\oplus a=a$. $e$ is called the identity element. Sometimes it is also denoted by a **bold** \"one\": $\\boldsymbol{1}$\n",
    "- Inverse element: $\\forall a\\in G, \\exists a^{-1}\\in G, a\\oplus a^{-1}=a^{-1}\\oplus a=e$. $a^{-1}$ is called the inverse element of $a$.\n",
    "- Commutativity: $\\forall a,b\\in G, a\\oplus b=b\\oplus a$\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Note that the symbol $\\forall$ means \"for all\" and $\\exists$ means \"there exists\")_\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with Object Oriented Programming, you can think of an Abelian Group as a `class` with a `method` that takes two `instances` of the `class` and returns another `instance` of the `class`. The `class` is the set $G$, the `method` is the binary operation $\\oplus$, and the `instances` are the elements of the set $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples of Abelian Groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operation $+$ (addition) is an Abelian Group. The identity element is $0$ and the inverse element of $a$ is $-a$. _(See why [earlier](#1.1-Number-Sets) we mentioned that subtraction is an alias? It is an alias for \"addition with the inverse\")_\n",
    "- The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operation $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) is **NOT** an Abelian Group. The identity element is $1$ but the inverse element of $a$ is $\\frac{1}{a}$, which is NOT an element of $\\mathbb{Z}$. _(Again, see why [earlier](#1.1-Number-Sets) we mentioned that division is an alias? It is an alias for \"multiplication with the inverse\")_.\n",
    "- The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ with the binary operation $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) is an Abelian Group. The identity element is $1$ and the inverse element of $a$ is $\\frac{1}{a}$. _(See why [earlier](#1.1-Number-Sets) we mentioned that $\\mathbb{Q}$ is an extension of $\\mathbb{Z}$ ?)_\n",
    "\n",
    "If the commutativity property is not present in the Abelian Group, then it is just called a Group. _Can you think of an example of a tuple $(G,\\oplus)$ that is a Group but not an Abelian Group?_ ðŸ˜‰\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finite Groups, Group Order, Cyclic Groups and Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous examples of Abelian Groups are infinite (i.e. the set $G$ that composes $\\mathbb{G}$ contains an infinite amount of elements). But what if the set $G$ is finite? Then we call it a Finite Group. The number of elements in the grpup $\\mathbb{G}$ is called the order of the group, and is usually denoted by $\\left|\\mathbb{G}\\right|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to our example of the set of integers $\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ (which is a finite set) and the binary operation $+$. Is this a Finite Group? The answer is **NO**, because we lack **closure**: if we perform $2 + 3 = 5$, and $5$ is not in the set. However, if we change $+$ for $+$ under modulo $5$, then we do get a Finite Group, because this time $2 + 3 = 5\\equiv 0\\quad\\text{mod}~5$. Indeed, all groups $(\\mathbb{Z}_n, +~\\text{mod}~ n)$ are finite (abelian) groups, whose order is $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about Cyclic groups. A Cyclic Group is a group that can be generated by a single element, called **generator** by means of the binary operation. For example, $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operation addition $+$ is indeed an infinite cyclic group, which has two different generators: $1$ and $-1$, because every integer can be generated by adding $1$ or $-1$ to itself, or through their inverses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same happens with $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ with the binary operation addition $+$ under modulo $n$. For example, $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ has four generators: $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$, because every element of $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ can be generated by adding $1$ or $4$ to itself. In fact, every group $(\\mathbb{Z}_n, +~\\text{mod}~ n)$ is a cyclic group, and the generators are co-prime with $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's take the clock ($\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$) with the binary operation addition $+$ under modulo $12$. The generators are $1$, $5$, $7$ and $11$. Try it out! By now you must have noticed that $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p\\in\\mathbb{P}$ (i.e. the set of prime numbers) with the binary operation addition $+$ under modulo $p$ is very interesting because it is a **finite cyclic abelian group** whose generators are all the numbers in the set except $0$ (because trivially all the numbers in the set are coprime with $p$ ðŸ˜„).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Exponential Map\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a finite cyclic group $\\mathbb{G}=(G,\\oplus)$ of order $n$ ($\\left|\\mathbb{G}\\right|=n$; it contains $n$ elements) whose generator is $g$. The exponential map is a function that takes an integer $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}_n$ and returns the element of the group that is generated by $g^a$. One can understand $g^a$ as applying $a$ times the $\\oplus$ operation on $g$.\n",

    "Let's dig into an example for clarity: take the finite cyclic abelian group $\\mathbb{G}:=(\\mathbb{Z}_5, +~\\text{mod}~5)$ of order $5$, and let's choose the generator $2$ (you know it doesn't matter which one we choose because all the elements of $\\mathbb{G}$ except $0$ are generators).
